UFOs

Overview
In this module, we focused on creating a dynamic webpage that can accept different inputs and be able to display information about UFO sightings.

Results

To perform a search, you come across the main webpage and on the left of the screen there is a section to filter search certain information you want to look at.

From this section, you can filter out by entering a date you want to look at.When I filter out the date 1/11/2010, you will see the results of all UFO sightings from that date

If you want to look at UFO sightings based on their shape, you can enter the shape in the search box. I wanted to look at sightings that formed a triangle, so I searched based on the shape of a triangle and then I would get results of UFO sightings that formed a triangle.

With the filtered search, you can look up any information based on the shape, the date, or location of the sightings. 

Summary
-One drawback of the filter search is that the user might not know what city to search for, so they would have to look for a city that is included in the analysis
-one recommendation, would to include a dropdown list that includes all the filter values a user can select from
-A nice design feature could include a clear all filter button, so we won't have to have the user delete each search field
